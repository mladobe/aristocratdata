# Aristocrat Sample Data import
So we needed a demo of ACO for https://www.aristocratgaming.com to show their games being selectable and filterable in a user interface.
They don't need checkout so we thought ACO would be a good fit.

To get their games into a CSV file I just used https://webscraper.io/ which produced the https://github.com/mladobe/aristocratdata/blob/main/data/AristoCratWhereToPlay.csv file in this repo.
Then I just grabbed the https://github.com/adobe-commerce/aco-sample-catalog-data-ingestion repo, put the CSV in the data folder and used the following prompts to get the data into the https://github.com/mladobe/aristocratdata/blob/main/data/products.json, https://github.com/mladobe/aristocratdata/blob/main/data/metadata.json and (though unused) the https://github.com/mladobe/aristocratdata/blob/main/data/prices.json files.
I used the following prompts in Cursor to get the file transformed:
1. "Can you use the AristoCratWhereToPlay.csv file to replace the data in the products.json, prices.json and metadata.json files so I can run the import on those?"
1. "can you update the metadata and products json files to only use a single "Game Feature" filterable field using the values from feature_1, feature_2, feature_3, feature_4, feature_5 fields? SO they are filterable through a single option in the site"

These prompts gave me the https://github.com/mladobe/aristocratdata/blob/main/convert-csv.js file which I cursor ran to update the json files above.

*NOTE:* Using standard "en-US" locale for all catalog data (required for valid BCP 47 language tags)


Then I basically treated the thing like the sample data import process below, but with my own data.
Essentially just run:
 ```shell
 node index.js
 ```
Once you have your tenant ID and view ID and so on setup properly. (see instructions below from the main sample data repo)

## Policies and Catalog Views
I setup the below as my catalog views and policies to get this stuff showing up during import and in the Storefront

# Sample catalog data ingestion

This sample data set emulates the catalog data for a fictional B2B2X Automobile conglomerate called Carvelo. When ingested, this sample data creates a single base catalog that can be configured and filtered to deliver custom catalogs for different sales channels, locales, and customer segments.

The sample catalog data ingestion process described here is a prerequisite for completing the [Storefront and Catalog Administrator end-to-end use case](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/optimizer/use-case/admin-use-case) that demonstrates how to create custom catalogs to support sales operations for a complex business organization.


## About this repository

This repository provides the tools to ingest the sample data set into a Commerce Optimizer instance. The process uses the [Commerce Optimizer SDK](https://github.com/adobe-commerce/aco-ts-sdk/) which is based on the [Data Ingestion API](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/services/optimizer/data-ingestion/).

Also, you can use this repository code as the basis for loading your own commerce data to create a single base catalog to power any Commerce front end:

- Update the metadata, products, price books, and prices data in the [data files](https://github.com/adobe-commerce/aco-sample-catalog-data-ingestion/tree/main/data) with your own commerce data.
- Run the script to load the sample data.
- Use the Merchandising GraphQL APIs to retrieve catalog data for your frontend.


## What will you do?

You will ingest `Product Metadata`, `Product`, `Price Book`, and `Price` data for the Carvelo Automotive demo dataset.

Using our Commerce Optimizer Typescript SDK, we will ingest:

- Metadata for our Product attributes
- 1080 Products across our 3 brands (in batches of 100)
- 5 unique Price Books
- 6480 Prices across our 5 Price Books (in batches of 100)

After you ingest the data, setup Adobe Commerce Optimizer by [defining catalog views and policies](#create-catalog-views-and-policies) to filter the base catalog data. Then, you can integrate with an Adobe Commerce Edge Delivery Services storefront to deliver custom catalogs for your business use cases.

## Environment setup

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed in your local development environment:

- Node.js version 20.14.0 or higher
- Access to Adobe Commerce Optimizer instance
- Developer access to Adobe Developer Console to create IMS credentials
- Basic familiarity with Commerce Optimizer concepts

### Install dependencies

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.

1. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies to run the sample data ingestion.

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### Get credentials and tenant ID for your instance

You need the following values to authenticate requests to ingest data from the sample data set to your Commerce Optimizer instance.

- **Tenant_ID**—Identifies the Commerce Optimizer instance targeted for data ingestion.
- **Adobe IMS `client_id` and `client_secret` credentials**—These authentication credentials are required to authenticate API requests for data ingestion. You create these credentials from the Adobe Developer Console, which requires an Adobe account with developer access to the Adobe Commerce Optimizer.

#### Get your tenant ID

Find your tenant ID in the access URLs for your Commerce Optimizer instance in Cloud Manager.

1. Log in to your [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com/) account.

1. Under **Quick access**, click **Commerce** to open the Commerce Cloud Manager.

   The Commerce Cloud Manager displays a list of instances that are available in your Adobe IMS organization.

1. To view the access URLs including the base URL for the REST and GraphQL APIs, click the information icon next to the instance name.

   <img width="895" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d24bb12-3ac4-46ed-aad5-9e85176da6ef" />

1. Your tenant ID is included in the endpoint details. For example, you can see it in the Catalog Endpoint that follows this pattern:

   https://na1-sandbox.api.commerce.adobe.com/{tenantId}/v1/catalog

   **Note:**  If you don't have access to the Commerce Cloud Manager, contact your system administrator.

#### Generate the IMS credentials for API authentication

You generate the `client_ID` and `client_secret` credentials from the Adobe Developer Console. You must have a system administrator or developer role for the Commerce Optimizer project to complete this configuration. See [User Management](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-developers.html) in the *Commerce Optimizer* documentation.

1. Log in to the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console).

1. Select the Experience Cloud Organization for the integration.

1. Create an API project.

   - Add the **Adobe Commerce Optimizer Ingestion** API to your project. Then, click **Next**.

   - Select the **Default - Cloud Manager** profile.

   - Click **Save configured API**.

1. In the Connected Credentials section, view API configuration details by selecting **OAUTH Server-to-Server**.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34a7e7b2-9816-462b-8453-a28a22d673fa)

1. Copy the Client ID and the Client Secret values to a secure location.

### Configure environment variables

The `.env.dist` file provides the configuration template to instantiate the SDK client and provide secure communication between the client and Commerce Optimizer.

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.

1. **Create environment file**

   ```shell
   cp .env.dist .env
   ```

1. Edit the .env file to add your credentials.

   - Add the IMS client id and client secret credentials from your Adobe Developer project.

     ```conf
     CLIENT_ID=my-client-id
     CLIENT_SECRET=my-client-secret
     ```

   - Add the tenant Id for your Commerce Optimizer instance.

     ```conf
     TENANT_ID=my-tenant-id
     REGION=na1
     ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
     ```

1. Save your changes.

## Ingest the data into Commerce Optimizer

 The ingestion process handles data in the following order:

 1. Product Metadata (10 items)
 1. Products (1080 items in batches of 100)
 1. Price Books (5 items)
 1. Prices (6480 items in batches of 100)

Run the following command to ingest the Carvelo sample data found in the `data` directory.

 ```shell
 node index.js
 ```

You should see output similar to the following:

 ```shell
> $ node index.js
Ingesting metadata batch 1 containing 10 items                  #  Ingesting the metadata for the product attributes

...

Metadata batch 1 response: { status: 'ACCEPTED', acceptedCount: 10 }
Successfully ingested 10 out of 10 items
Ingesting products batch 1 containing 100 products
Products batch 1 response: { status: 'ACCEPTED', acceptedCount: 100 }  # Ingesting product data
Ingesting products batch 2 containing 100 products

...

Successfully ingested 1080 out of 1080 products
Ingesting price books batch 1 containing 5 price books                    # Ingesting price books data
Price books batch 1 response: { status: 'ACCEPTED', acceptedCount: 5 }
Successfully ingested 5 out of 5 price books
Ingesting prices batch 1 containing 100 prices                         # Ingesting price data
Prices batch 1 response: { status: 'ACCEPTED', acceptedCount: 100 }
Ingesting prices batch 2 containing 100 prices
Prices batch 2 response: { status: 'ACCEPTED', acceptedCount: 100 }
Ingesting prices batch 3 containing 100 prices
Prices batch 3 response: { status: 'ACCEPTED', acceptedCount: 100 }

...

Successfully ingested 6480 out of 6480 prices

```

## Reset the sample data

To reset the sample catalog data in your Commerce Optimizer instance, run the following script to delete the Carvelo catalog data loaded by the `index.js` ingestion script.

 ```shell
 node reset.js
 ```

 ## Configure Commerce Optimizer

Set up the catalog view and polices required to filter the base catalog data to create custom catalogs and pricing based on business use cases.

## Create catalog views and policies

From the Commerce Optimizer user interface, create the catalog views and policies required to use the sample data with your storefront.

**Note:** See the documentation to learn more about [catalog views](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/optimizer/setup/catalog-view), [policies](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/optimizer/setup/policies), and policy types [policy types](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/optimizer/catalog/policies#value-source-types).

### Create universal policies

Create four universal (STATIC) policies with the following configuration settings:

| Policy Name  | Attribute | Operator | Value source | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| West Coast Inc brands | brand | IN | STATIC | Aurora, Bolt, Cruz |
| East Coast Inc brands  | brand  | IN | STATIC | Bolt, Cruz |
| Arkbridge part categories  | part_category  | IN | STATIC | tires, brakes, suspension |
| Kingsbluff part categories | part_category | IN | STATIC | tires, brakes |

**Create each universal policy**

1. Log in to Commerce Optimizer.

1. Navigate to **Catalog > Policies**.

1. Click **Add Policy**.

1. Enter the policy name.

1. Configure the static filter: Click **Add Filter**.

1. Add the filter details

   - Click **Add Filter**
   - For **Attribute**, enter the attribute name from the table.
   - For **Operator**, select `IN`
   - For **Value source**, select `STATIC`
   - For **value**, add the values one at a time, then press enter.


   The modal should look like the screenshot below.

   ![Commerce Optimizer universal (static) policy configuration](./assets/aco-sample-data-setup-create-static-policy.png)

1. Apply configuration changes: Click **Save**.

1. Activate the policy you have just created by clicking the action dots (…) and selecting **Enable**.

1. Save the policy: Click **Save**.

### Create exclusive (TRIGGER) policies

Create two exclusive policies with the following configuration settings:

| Policy Name  | Trigger - Name | Trigger - transport type | Attribute | Operator | Value source | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Brand  | AC-Policy-Brand  | HTTP_HEADER | model | IN | TRIGGER | AC-Policy-Brand |
| Model  | AC-Policy-Model  | HTTP_HEADER | model | IN | TRIGGER | AC-Policy-Model |

**Create each exclusive policy**

Use the values from the table to create each policy.

1. From the **Catalog > Policies** page, click **Add Policy**

1. Enter the policy name.

1. Configure the Trigger details: Click **Add Trigger**.

   - For **Name**, add the trigger name value, for example `AC-Policy-Brand`
   - For **Transport type**, select `HTTP_HEADER`
   - Click **Save**

1. Add the filter details for the trigger: Click **Add Filter**

   - For **Attribute**, enter the attribute name from the table.
   - For **Operator**, select **IN**.
   - For **Value source**, select **TRIGGER**.
   - For **Value**, enter the trigger name, for example `AC-Policy-Brand`
   - Click **Save**.
   - Activate the policy by clicking on the action dots (…) and selecting **Enable**.

### Verify policies

After you create the six policies, verify that the policy list page includes all the policies.

![Composable Catalog policies for sample data](./assets/aco-sample-data-setup-policies-created.png)

**Important:** Ensure that all of your policies have a status of `Enabled`.

### Create Catalog Views

1. In the Commerce Optimizer interface, navigate to **Catalog > Views**.

1. Create three catalog views that use your newly created policies.

   - Click **Add Catalog View**.
   - Add the following details:
     Name: `Global`
     Catalog Sources: `en-US` (make sure you hit **enter** button after typing in this value)
     Policies: `Brand`, `Model`, `West Coast Inc brands`

     The modal should look like the screenshot below.

     ![Screenshot 2025-06-11 at 4 15 19 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23267d3b-390a-42d9-890f-d8d9de2013f5)

   - Click **Save**.

   Repeat the above steps to create two more catalog views. Use the following details:

   | Name  | Catalog Sources | Policies |
   | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
   | Arkbridge  | en-US  | `Brand` `Model` `West Coast Inc brands` `Arkbridge part categories`|
   | Kingsbluff  | en-US  | `Brand` `Model` `East Coast Inc brands` `Kingsbluff part categories`|

At this point you have created three catalog views and six policies that reflect the business structure and sales operations flow for the sample Carvelo organization. You are now ready to [set up your storefront](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/optimizer/storefront).

## Explore the SDK

### Client

To get started with the Adobe Commerce Optimizer SDK, you first need to create the client. In order to do
this, use the `createClient` function provided in the `@adobe-commerce/aco-ts-sdk` package. The `createClient` function
accepts a client configuration object of type `ClientConfig`. The `ClientConfig` object requires the following:

- `credentials`: The credentials object contains the IMS fields needed to authenticate with the ACO APIs
  - `clientId`: This is your client id found in the Adobe Developer Console.
  - `clientSecret`: This is your client secret found in the Adobe Developer Console.
- `tenantId`: This is the identifier for your ACO instance.
- `region`: This is the region in which your ACO instance is deployed. Example: `na1`.
- `environment`: This is your ACO instance's environment type: `sandbox` or `production`

```typescript
import {
  createClient,
  consoleLogger,
  Client,
  ClientConfig,
  Environment,
  LogLevel,
  Region,
} from "@adobe-commerce/aco-ts-sdk";

// Define your configuration
const config: ClientConfig = {
  credentials: {
    clientId: "my-client-id", // Your IMS client id from Dev Console
    clientSecret: "my-client-secret", // Your IMS client secret from Dev Console
  },
  tenantId: "my-tenant-id", // Your instance's tenant id found in Commerce Cloud Manager UI
  region: "na1" as Region, // Your instance's region found in Commerce Cloud Manager UI
  environment: "sandbox" as Environment, // Your instance's environment type: sandbox or production
  timeoutMs: 30000, // Optional. HTTP timeout override in ms. Default is 10000ms
  logger: consoleLogger(LogLevel.DEBUG), // Optional. Pass in your existing logger. If not provided, a default console logger is used. See Types -> Logger section below.
};

// Initialize the client instance
const client: Client = createClient(config);
```

### Client Functions

Each entity provides a `create`, `update`, and `delete` function (ie. `createPriceBooks`). Using your Codespaces IDE, inspect each method and their parameter types to get a feel for the API.

Supported Entities:

- Products
- Product Metadata
- Price Books
- Prices

### Product Operations

#### Create Products

```typescript
import {
  FeedProduct,
  FeedProductStatusEnum,
  FeedProductVisibleInEnum,
} from "@adobe-commerce/aco-ts-sdk";

const product1: FeedProduct = {
  sku: "EXAMPLE-SKU-001",
  source: { locale: "en-US" },
  name: "Example Product 1",
  slug: "example-product-1",

// response.data: { status: 'ACCEPTED', acceptedCount: 1 }
```

## Types

See the [types.ts](https://github.com/adobe-commerce/aco-ts-sdk/blob/main/src/types.ts) file for all exported type
definitions.

### Client Config

The `ClientConfig` object is required to be passed into the `createClient` function. It configures how the SDK client
will interact with Adobe Commerce Optimizer services.

```typescript
/**
 * Client configuration
 *
 * @param credentials - Adobe IMS credentials for authentication
 * @param tenantId - The tenant ID for the API requests
 * @param region - The region for the API endpoint (e.g., 'us', 'eu')
 * @param environment - The environment to use ('production' or 'sandbox')
 * @param timeoutMs - The timeout for the API requests
 * @param logger - Optional logger for customizing logging behavior
 */
export interface ClientConfig {
  credentials: AdobeCredentials;
  tenantId: string;
  region: Region;
  environment: Environment;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  logger?: Logger;
}
```

### Logger

The Adobe Commerce Optimizer SDK provides flexible logging capabilities through the `Logger` interface. You can either
use the default console logger or implement your own logger that matches the interface.

#### Default Logger

The default console logger that can be used like this:

```typescript
import { consoleLogger, LogLevel } from "@adobe-commerce/aco-ts-sdk";

const config: ClientConfig = {
  // ... other config options ...
  logger: consoleLogger(LogLevel.INFO), // Uses default console logger
};
```

#### Custom Logger

You can implement your own logger by creating an object that implements the `Logger` interface. This is useful for
integrating with your existing logging infrastructure and customizing log formats.

```typescript
/**
 * Logger interface for customizing logging behavior
 *
 * @param debug - Log a debug message
 * @param info - Log an info message
 * @param warn - Log a warning message
 * @param error - Log an error message
 */
export interface Logger {
  debug(message: string, meta?: Record<string, unknown>): void;
  info(message: string, meta?: Record<string, unknown>): void;
  warn(message: string, meta?: Record<string, unknown>): void;
  error(message: string, error?: Error, meta?: Record<string, unknown>): void;
}

/**
 * Log level
 *
 * @param DEBUG - Debug log level
 * @param INFO - Info log level
 * @param WARN - Warning log level
 * @param ERROR - Error log level
 */
export enum LogLevel {
  DEBUG = 0,
  INFO = 1,
  WARN = 2,
  ERROR = 3,
}
```

##### Using Winston

The [Winston Logger](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) interface matches the SDK's `Logger` interface and is a
drop-in logger override.

```typescript
import winston from "winston";

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: "debug",
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [new winston.transports.Console()],
});
// ...
const config: ClientConfig = {
  // ... other config options ...
  logger, // Uses winston logger from your application
};
```

##### Using Pino

The [Pino Logger](https://getpino.io) interface does not exactly match the SDK's `Logger` interface, but can be easily
adapted to be provided as a logger override.

```typescript
import pino from "pino";

// Create a simple adaptor for the Pino logger interface
const createPinoAdapter = (pinoInstance) => {
  const logWithMetadata = (level, message, ...args) => {
    const metadata = args[0];
    if (metadata && typeof metadata === "object" && metadata !== null) {
      pinoInstance[level](metadata, message);
    } else {
      pinoInstance[level](message, ...args);
    }
  };

  return {
    debug: (message, ...args) => logWithMetadata("debug", message, ...args),
    info: (message, ...args) => logWithMetadata("info", message, ...args),
    warn: (message, ...args) => logWithMetadata("warn", message, ...args),
    error: (message, error, ...args) => {
      if (error instanceof Error) {
        const metadata = args[0];
        if (metadata && typeof metadata === "object" && metadata !== null) {
          pinoInstance.error({ ...metadata, err: error }, message);
        } else {
          pinoInstance.error({ err: error }, message);
        }
      } else if (error && typeof error === "object") {
        pinoInstance.error(error, message);
      } else {
        pinoInstance.error(message);
      }
    },
  };
};
const logger = createPinoAdapter(pino({ level: "debug" }));
// ...
const config: ClientConfig = {
  // ... other config options ...
  logger, // Uses pino logger from your application
};
```
